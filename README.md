This is a simple RGB to HSV converter. 
To use, place Math.py in a Python IDE and run it. 
The window that opens has six sliders: change RGB however you'd like for a live visualization in the colour visualizer. The HSV sliders also update to match the RGB values entered. You can also adjust the H,S, and V sliders to change which colour is shown, and the RGB sliders adjust to match the new colour
